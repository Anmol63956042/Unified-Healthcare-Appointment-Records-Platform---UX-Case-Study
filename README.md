1. Overview
Project Goal
The aim of this project was to design a unified healthcare platform that allows patients to book appointments seamlessly, manage their health records digitally in one place, and access secure tele-consultation services. The system also needed to support doctors in efficiently managing their time slots, patient histories, and consultation preparation.
The Problem
Healthcare interactions are fragmented across multiple touchpoints: patients struggle to keep track of appointments, maintain medical records across hospitals and clinics, and often forget medications. On the doctor’s side, scattered records and inefficient scheduling tools make consultations time-consuming. Existing healthcare apps often replicate hospital workflows without rethinking user experience, leading to cluttered, overwhelming interfaces.
The Opportunity
A platform that integrates appointments, health records, reminders, and tele-consultation into a single, trustworthy experience could greatly improve adoption. By prioritizing simplicity, accessibility, and trust, the product could serve both patients and doctors—two very different user groups—with tailored flows.

2. Research
Secondary Research
I began by analyzing existing healthcare apps in the Indian market, such as:
•	Practo
•	Apollo 24/7
•	Tata 1mg
•	Pharmeasy (limited doctor integration)
Key Findings from Competitor Analysis
•	Complex Flows: Booking often required 6–8 steps, involving specialty, location, date, doctor, confirmation, and payment.
•	Fragmented Records: Reports were stored in separate modules without easy linkage to consultations.
•	Poor Reminder Systems: Appointment and medicine reminders often relied on push notifications (easy to miss).
•	Trust Issues: Users hesitated to upload reports due to unclear privacy practices.
•	Limited Elderly Support: Small fonts, cluttered screens, and dependence on typing created barriers.
Example User Reviews (paraphrased)
•	“I just wanted to book a cardiologist for my father, but it took 10 minutes of filling forms.”
•	“Lost my prescription upload after app update, very frustrating.”
•	“Why do you need my Aadhaar to book a simple appointment?”
•	“App keeps pushing pharmacy offers but I just want to see my doctor.”
Constraints Identified
•	Privacy: Users need confidence their sensitive data is secure.
•	Trust: Clear communication about data handling is essential.
•	Accessibility: Elderly and rural users may struggle with digital literacy.
•	Offline Users: Some consultations may still happen offline; app must support hybrid usage.
Key Research Insights
1.	Reminders Work Best When Familiar: Users prefer WhatsApp-style reminders (simple text notifications).
2.	Accessibility Matters: Elderly benefit from large fonts, high contrast, and voice assistance.
3.	Transparency = Trust: Clearly visible privacy controls (consent toggles, usage explanations) encourage data sharing.
4.	Unified Records = Differentiator: Competitors lacked a single view of patient history across doctors and hospitals.
5.	Multi-stakeholder Complexity: Patients and doctors have very different needs—requiring role-based dashboards.

3. Personas
Based on research synthesis, I created two primary personas:
Persona 1 — Patient
Name: Ramesh Sharma (50)
Occupation: Shop owner
Tech Proficiency: Moderate (WhatsApp, UPI)
Goals:
•	Book doctor appointments easily.
•	Receive reliable medication reminders.
•	Access all past medical records in one place.
Pain Points:
•	Forgets pills frequently.
•	Struggles to find reports when visiting new doctors.
•	Finds most healthcare apps confusing.
Scenario: Ramesh wants to consult a cardiologist for his checkup, upload his old ECG reports, and receive medicine reminders post-consultation.
________________________________________
Persona 2 — Doctor
Name: Dr. Meera Iyer (38)
Occupation: General Physician at private clinic
Tech Proficiency: High (uses digital tools daily)
Goals:
•	Manage consultation slots efficiently.
•	Access patient records quickly during appointments.
•	Reduce no-shows by having patients reminded in advance.
Pain Points:
•	Records often scattered across files, WhatsApp, and patient memory.
•	Patients come unprepared without history.
•	No intuitive way to manage time slots across multiple platforms.
Scenario: Dr. Meera wants to set her availability, prepare for each patient by reviewing records in advance, and consult over video for remote cases.
________________________________________
Design Implications from Personas
•	For patients like Ramesh: Flows must be simple, with visual cues and reminders.
•	For doctors like Meera: Efficiency, structured records, and quick context access are critical.
•	Both require trust cues (privacy, security, reliability).

4. User Flows & Journeys
Patient Flow (Booking a Doctor)
1.	Login/Sign-Up (with phone number OTP for simplicity).
2.	Dashboard → “Book Doctor.”
3.	Select Specialty/Doctor (search, filters).
4.	Choose Slot (calendar view, clear availability).
5.	Upload Records (optional but encouraged).
6.	Confirm Appointment.
7.	Receive Reminders (push + WhatsApp-style).
Journey Map Example
•	Emotion: Anxiety at start → Relief on seeing simple steps → Satisfaction with reminders.
•	Pain Point Reduced: From 7 steps in competitors → 3 streamlined steps.

9. Usability Testing
Method
•	5 participants (3 patients, 2 doctors).
•	Task-based testing:
1.	Book a doctor.
2.	Upload a report.
3.	Join a tele-consultation.
Metrics Collected
•	Task Completion Rate: % of users completing without help.
•	Time on Task: Faster = better.
•	Error Count: Wrong taps, backtracking.
•	SUS Score: Subjective usability satisfaction.
Findings
•	Patients loved simple slot selection but struggled with record upload labels → fixed with clearer icons.
•	Doctors wanted availability to show recurring slots → iteration added weekly templates.
•	Reminders were too subtle → redesigned as larger banner cards + notifications.
